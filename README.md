# Bilateral Stimulation Demo

Bilateral stimulation is stimuli (visual, auditory or tactile) which occur in a rhythmic left-right pattern.Bilateral Stimulation is the use of alternating right, left stimulation such as tapping on the knees, legs or shoulders, tapping toes or feet on the floor, or eye movements. It is used to activate and integrate information from the brainâ€™s two hemispheres.
Several conditions can be treated with bilateral stimulation. It is a process that is used to help people with traumatic memories, and as such, children, adolescents, and adults with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are some of the primary patients.
Other conditions caused by adverse experiences, like childhood trauma, can be treated with bilateral stimulation.

### Potential Benefits of Using Bilateral Stimulation
    - better anxiety management
    - increased happiness
    - increased self-esteem
    - higher levels of creativity
    - enhanced performance

### Project
This is a demo svelte project that mimics the use of bilateral stimulation remotely, enabling therapists to treat patients online and remotely due to convenience in the post covid era.
The therapist is able to send the patient a real time session, that they can then use to perform the therapy.
Realtime communication is enabled using [Ably](https://ably.com/)

For a simple demo, check out [here](https://demo-bilateral-7e2hxh87o-smlukwiya.vercel.app/);

## To run the project
Git clone the project
> You must have an app key from [ably](https://ably.com/) to be able to create real time sessions

Once you've cloned and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

A standard and well built version of the tool can be found [here](https://www.bilateralstimulation.io/)
